# RedR Disaster Simulation Program

Install notes

- [Latest node version ](node install npm)need version 12, previous versions do not contain worker threads module, please update to version 12
- preferably, one of the jetbrains IDE's. There are many reasons i am suggesting this. Primarily it contains the most bulit in features compared to 
any ide that I have seen before.
    - Git integration
    - Support for visual merges with input and output displayed
    
    
- some form of git
- command line to run npm install to build the node modules for the project.
