# RedR Disaster Simulation Program

Install notes

- some form of git
- command line to run npm install to build the node modules for the project. (also done by the IDE below)
- [Latest node version ](https://nodejs.org/en/) need version 12, previous versions do not contain worker threads module, please update to version 12
- preferably, [ one of the jetbrains IDE's.](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/ENGR300-2019/Project-16/redr-disaster-simulation-program/wikis/Jetbrains-Products-for-Development)

- There are many reasons i am suggesting this. Primarily it contains the most bulit in features compared to
any ide that I have seen before.
    - Git integration
    - Support for visual merges with input and output displayed.

#

- [Material Theme UI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui). Personally, my favourite theme for Jetbrains products. Easy to install and use

#
- Git Branches in WebStorm, merging branch X into your current branch
- ability to delete branches

#
- visual git history - selecting a directory or file
![viewing git history on a file or directory](RedR-Disaster-Simulator/DisasterSimulatorNodeJSServer/resources/js/vis-4.21.0/examples/network/img/soft-scraps-icons/viewing%20git%20history%20on%20a%20file%20or%20directory.png)
#
- viewing the git history visually for a selected file or directory

- merging any branch into the currently selected branch, example is merging a different branch into master

- [Markdown and pdf printing support extension for jetbrains IDE's](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7896-markdown-navigator) .
  - Definitely worth paying for the [enhanced edition](https://vladsch.com/product/markdown-navigator) and makes working entirely from the IDE possible
