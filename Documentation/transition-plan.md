**Transition Plan**
**October 11**
**Project Name:** Disaster Master

**Introduction**

The main goal of this project was to create a disaster simulator for training disaster relief workers. This team has produced a local web app that primarily facilitates communication between the trainer as the HQ, and the trainee groups as NGOs (non-government organisations). In order to demonstrate this Web App to the client Regan Potangaroa (on behalf on RedR Australia), the Team has deployed it to multiple Heroku hosting sites being: http://redr-disaster-simulator.herokuapp.com and http://disaster-simulator-testing.herokuapp.com. However, as of 11/ 10/19, the client no longer desires for this Heroku hosting, rather this web-app will be hosted within supported environments, as need be and setup by the client. And furthermore this web app will become open for use and modification by anyone under the open source GNU General Public License v3.0 and publicly available on GitHub. This transition plan describes the work required to transition the web app from Heroku to the Client locally.

**Assumptions**

- Support for the program will be handled by Regan as the representative for the program and RedR Australia.
- There are no running costs after the transition date as it will not be run locally nor hosted on any external service.
- The client's opinion regarding external web based hosting to support the web app is still such that they do not want this.
- The Admin of the Heroku sites utilised (James Quilty), will take the required actions necessary to terminate these sites
- The Team will prepare the software solution for handover, by creating an executable portable extractor of developed coding files and there dependency's, as desired by the client
- The team will then fork their Gitlab Repository, to the clients Public Github Repository and upload the portable version of the product as mentioned in the previous assumption along side it

**Organisation**

Regan as the representative for RedR Australia will lead all efforts for support, monitoring the public repository, and new directions for the project.

**Work Required**

- The Team will inform the client how to access the portable product version, for downloading to their environments
- The client will then download the portable version of the product, install it, as documented in the help documentation, and at this point in this process the transfer can be considered completed.

**Schedule**

There is no schedule for continued maintenance or operation of the project content.
